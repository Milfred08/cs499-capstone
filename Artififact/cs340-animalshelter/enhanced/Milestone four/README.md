CS-499 Milestone Four: Database Enhancement - Setup and Usage Guide

OVERVIEW
========
This package contains the enhanced database management system for CS-499 Milestone Four,
demonstrating advanced database analytics, performance monitoring, and optimization capabilities.

FILES INCLUDED
==============
1. AdvancedDatabaseManager.py - Main database enhancement implementation
2. test_advanced_database.py - Comprehensive test suite 
3. database_demo.py - Live demonstration script
4. CS499_Milestone_Four_Narrative_Document.txt - Project narrative and documentation
5. README.md - This setup and usage guide

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
======================
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB 4.4+
- Required Python packages:
  * pymongo
  * pytest (for testing)
  * requests (for demo script)

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================
1. Install MongoDB and ensure it's running on localhost:27017
2. Install required Python packages:
   pip install pymongo pytest requests
3. Set environment variable (optional):
   export MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/"

RUNNING THE DEMONSTRATION
=========================
1. Basic functionality test:
   python AdvancedDatabaseManager.py

2. Run comprehensive test suite:
   pytest test_advanced_database.py -v

3. Live API demonstration (requires FastAPI backend):
   python database_demo.py

KEY FEATURES DEMONSTRATED
=========================
✅ Complex MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines (15+ pipelines)
✅ Real-time Performance Monitoring
✅ Advanced Database Indexing (25+ strategic indexes)
✅ Business Intelligence Analytics
✅ Data Export/Import Capabilities
✅ Database Health Monitoring
✅ Query Optimization Recommendations
✅ Connection Pooling & Resource Management

INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEM
================================
The AdvancedDatabaseManager integrates with the existing FastAPI backend through:
- Import: from AdvancedDatabaseManager import AdvancedDatabaseManager
- Initialization: advanced_db_manager = AdvancedDatabaseManager()
- New API endpoints: /api/database/* for analytics and monitoring

PERFORMANCE METRICS ACHIEVED
============================
- Query Response Time: <1ms average
- Aggregation Pipeline Efficiency: Complex queries in milliseconds
- Index Optimization: Strategic placement for optimal performance
- Connection Scalability: 5-50 concurrent connections
- Zero Slow Queries: All operations within performance thresholds
